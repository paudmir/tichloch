                "txt" : ["After the company I worked for laid me off, my TN visa became invalid and I entered the 60-day grace period after which I would have to leave the country. Having to sell my new car, my new house, and planning all the moving logistics without a job became stressful. Me and my family packed 11 boxes including shoes, clothes, and linens to be sent to Colima (MX).","We bought an old SUV and a friend of ours (who had another one) offered to help us move our valuable belongings to Monterrey (MX). However, once at the border, he didn't have the right permit to drive his SUV into Mexico, so we ended up in Laredo, TX.", "We rented a storage unit and looked for moving services, but everything was too expensive. So, we drove our SUV with some items across the border, but we were very scared because the border is quite unsafe. We asked some Mexican teenagers we encountered on the road 'Which port of entry did you cross on your way here?' and they mentioned Puente Colombia. We got some courage, and drove to that one.", "When we had just crossed the border, the SUV broke down right by the time we reached the first toll. We called our families in Monterrey, and they escorted us the rest of the way. We took the SUV to the mechanic, got it fixed and went back to the border and...prayed we could be let in again (since our visas were no longer valid after we left US).", "In Mexico, we were lucky the customs officer didn't inspect our vehicle, otherwise we would've had to pay something there too. I remember I had packed a BB fun (which looked very real) and my wife was scared it as gonna cause us trouble even if we tossed it in the trash. So, we went to the closest police station to drop it off voluntarily.", "The police officer at the desk told us to wait for a bit, and then asked us to follow him 'cause he was interested in purchasing the gun. So, we left the police station and walked a couple of blocks away. By then, I told him I just really wanted to get rid of it so he could have it for free. He asked why and we explained the whole situation. The officer told us he was married to a 'dreamer', and that he was also scared about what could happen to his family.", "He told us about a cousin he had who owned a truck and carried short distance move-out trips to Monterrey. We were afraid the cousin would screw us up once we all crossed the border, but we just put our faith in God and decided to make the deal and everything turned out fine. We moved the rest of our stuff into Mexico, and never plan to go back to US.", "It's kinda sad to leave your house and go back to depend on your parents or their own home. But we have faith that we'll get back on our feet again."]

                "txt" : ["I migrated to US in 2013 with a TN visa sponsored by my workplace. Although it was a contractor position, I saw it as a chance to grow professionally and personally. I kept renovating my visa each year from 2013 to 2020. By then, I could already fill out the DS-160 with my eyes closed in just a couple of minutes. I knew the process to perfection, and interviews at the consulate were never long.","In 2020, before COVID hit, my company gave me the opportunity to switch to an H-1B so I could apply to be a permanent resident. And so, my office put me in touch with a law firm, I applied to the H-1B lottery, I won and my H-1B application got approved. While the world stood still due to the pandemic, my immigration process kept going and I got my I-797 showing my new H-1B status.", "I kept working, as usual, and on December of 2021, I decided to visit my family in Mexico. This meant I had to schedule a visa appointment at the consulate to get it stamped on my passport, as that is the de jure proof that Customs asks to let you back in. I thought I was going to be there for just a couple of weeks, but I ended up being very mistaken about that.",
                "The interview at the consulate was uneventful. I was asked to pay for the visa and to go back to the window to get further instructions. They handed me a paper with the new process that was going to take place due to my change of status. I was confused, but trusted everything was going to be ok since other friends had gone through something similar.","Minutes later, I got an email asking me to fill out another form (DS-5535) with a lot of data from the last 15 years: places I had lived in, jobs, countries I'd been to, etc. I called my girlfriend to tell her what had happened and jokinly said 'I'll be back in January, unless they deny it haha'. But days passed by, I sent an email before Christmas asking if there were any updates and got the same generic response 'We will let you know where there is one'.","I kept checking the website every day and the status field kept showing up as 'Refused'. Apparently, this was normal until all the background-checking agencies had completed their work. However, time passed by and nothing changed. I did some research on this kind of situations, and most people in them were either from the Middle East or India, and they had been waiting for years for a resolution." ,"Thinking the worst, I got in touch with my job's law firm, who took my case seriously but told me there was a huge backlog of people from the COVID era, so a longer wait time was normal. However, my workplace had already given me a date to be back or else...I was also running out of PTO at work and kept paying my rent in USA while...I crashed at my parents' house. My girlfriend was sad and worried and suggested reaching out to a senator in Maryland for help, which she did!", "The senator's immigration assistant was incredibly kind and helpful and called and emailed the consulate in Guadalajara asking for updates too, but got the same response: Still processing.", "The date my workplace had given me finally came and they decided to move to an 'offshore' position. No more updates appeared in the website by then. And so, the packing activities to move back began. I called my landlord in Maryland to explain him the situation, friends of mine packed the stuff in my apartment and kept my car in their garage. I was still hopeful I would get my visa soon.", "I was very stressed and anxious due to the immigration process, the deadlines at work, my long distance relationship. It was so weird being at home for so long after 15 years. After a year of consternation to the fullest, on October of 2022 I got a call from the consulate. And as I had just confirmed my name, the call drops."," I immediately went to check the website and it still showed 'Refused' but with a new date. I tried calling and sending an email, but no response. Finally, on Monday, I got a call saying 'Your visa has been approved and it will be delivered at the address specified in your application. No apologies, no nothing.", "Since it had taken so long, my workplace had filled my req with someone else, so I had to look for another position, which I did and found one...but in South Carolina. I was able to go back to Maryland, just to pick up my stuff and move to a city where I didn't know anyone. Living again with the stress of being on a work visa. Being dependent on a client, a project or a sponsor."]

DHL sent some documents to Netherlands (NL) instead of Monterrey, NL ('NL' stands for Nuevo Leon, a state in Mexico), so I had to 'fix' that by paying extra...and without a job to get me more income. I paid because my musical instruments are my life.", "I was scared my boxes were going to be opened by customs in Mexico and that they would steal expensive stuff. Almost had a heart attack when a box was labeled 'guitar', but no guitar was there. They had just mislabeled it. In the end, all my stuff made it home."]

            "txt": ["We started our journey back in Milpitas, CA. We rented a U-Haul, and drove all the way down to San Diego. From there, the plan was to cross to Tijuana and drive to Monterrey. Unfortunately, the damn customs officers in Mexico took my husband hostage.", "First, when we arrived to their office, he handed in the paperwork and they made him wait for 2 hours until he asked if there was anything missing. They replied with 'Missing what? You haven't provided anything to us'. From there, they took him to another office where he saw how they opened our boxes and took everything out. Finally, they told him 'If you want to cross the border, you're going to have to come with us to an ATM'.", "At the ATM, they told him to  withdraw everything in the account. Fortunately, there was a limit per day. Otherwise, we would've ran out of money. The guy who helped us move our stuff from San Diego to Tijuana was also colluding with customs. The moving service to Monterrey was waiting for us in Tijuana, but this person was the one holding the permit to move our stuff across the border.", "He wanted us to give show him the route that the moving service was going to take, to 'escort' that truck, but the moving service knew this was a tactic thieves use to rob people on the road. Knowing this, they have more than one truck with stuff they will move and they use others as decoys.", "Meanwhile, I had to sell my SUV (because  it couldn't cross into Mexico due to a restriction with the model) and I left in in San Diego. Some friends of hours helped me and my kids move our luggage, buuut -because it was a pick-up truck- we couldn't all fit in. So we took a couple of trips to cross. First, I went with my friend's husband. He went back to pick our luggage and my kids, and in the last trip he picked his kids and the rest of this family. ", "My husband and I were very shaken when eventually met and I came to know his oddisey at customs. By then, we didn't trust anyone anymore. Fortunately, my children were alright, our stuff got delivered 2 days later (although customs did steal some of our stuff). ", "My suggestion is to get rid of everything. All the system is rotten in Mexico and it makes something which is supposed to be simple become a nightmare."]
