Having to sell my new car, my new house, and planning all the moving logistics without a job became stressful. Me and my family packed 11 boxes: shoes, clothes, linens, everything to Colima (MX).","We bought an old SUV and a friend of ours has another one and offered to help us move our valuable belongings to Monterrey (MX). However, once at the border, he didn't have the right permit to drive his SUV into Mexico, so we ended up in Laredo, TX.", "We rented a storage unit and looked for moving services, but everything was too expensive. So, we drove our SUV with some items across the border, but we were very scared because the border is quite unsafe. We asked some Mexican kids which port of entry had used to cross, and they mentioned Colombia. We got some courage, and drove to that one.", "When we had just crossed the border, the SUV broke down right by the time we reached the first toll. We called our families in Monterrey, and they escorted us the rest of the way. We took the SUV to the mechanic, got it fixed and went back to the border and...prayed we could be let in again (since once our visas were no longer valid after we left US.)", "In Mexico, we were lucky the customs officer didn't inspect our vehicle, otherwise we would've had to pay something there too. I remember I had purchased and packed a BB fun (which looked very real) and my wife was scared it as gonna cause us trouble even if we tossed it in the trash. So, we went to the closest police station to drop it off voluntarily.", "The police office served us told us to wait for a bit, and then told us to follow him 'cause he was interested in purchasing the gun. So, we left the police station, walked a couple of blocks away. By then, I told him I just really wanted to get rid of it so he could have it for free, he asked why and we explained the whole situation. The office told us he was married to a 'dreamer', and that he too was scared about what could happen to his family.", "He told us about a cousin he had who had a truck and would do short distance move out trips to Monterrey. We were afraid the cousin would screw us up once we all crossed the border, but we just put our faith in God and decided to make the deal and everything turned out fine. We moved the rest of our stuff into Mexico, and never plan to go back to US."]

I thought it was a very remote possibility to get denied until...that day came and I was unable to go back.", "One person's decision can change all your plans, or, well, you can't actually make any medium or long term plans because you know you're always at risk of having to go back immediately."]

DHL sent some documents to Netherlands (NL) instead of Monterrey, NL ('NL' stands for Nuevo Leon, a state in Mexico), so I had to 'fix' that by paying extra...and without a job. I paid because my musical instruments are my life.", "I was scared my boxes were going to be opened by customs in Mexico and that they would steal expensive stuff. Almost had a heart attack when a box was labeled 'guitar' but no guitar was there. they had just mislabeled it.", "In the end, all my stuff made it home."]
